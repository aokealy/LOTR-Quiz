# User Expierence 
- When being a user I try to make the theme similar to Lord Of The Rings.
- When being a user I want to see the rules.
- When being a user I want to see the buttons easily. 
- When being a user I want to see the extra features.
- When being a user I want to play the game again.

## Site Structure 
- The structure of the Quiz is a home screen where rules and play button are set. 
- When clicking on the quiz there is a score on the top left and a timer on the top right.
- At the bottom of the quiz there is a next button and show results button.
- The show results page will give you the amount of correct and wrong answers.
- There is also a try again button to start the quiz again.


## Typography
- The font that were used in this Quiz was Lato.
- Lato is perhaps the most unique and interesting sans-serif font on this list. It was designed by Łukasz Dziedzic and includes 10 styles. It goes from thin all the way to ultra-bold. The letters in Lato have some unique curves which can only be seen in larger sizes.
## Colour Choice
- The colours I chose for this quiz were #d4af37 (Gold) to represent the One Ring.
- The second colour I chose is #FF7700 (orange) to represent The fire of Mount Doom.
- These colours make a good combination in relation to the movies.

      # Testing 
      ## Home Page
      - In this section I tested the code using <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea">WC3 Validator HTML</a>
       <img src="./assets/images/html-validator.jpg" alt="home page validator">
      ## Timeline Page
      <img src="./images/timeline-validator-img.jpg" alt="timeline validator">
      
      ## Gallery Page
      <img src="./images/gallery-validator-img.jpg" alt="gallery validator">
     
      - Also I tested the code using <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">WC3 Validator CSS</a>
         
         <img src="./images/css-validator-READme-img.jpg" alt="CSS Validator">

         - In the HTML part you can see I have a warning about not having a heading in the section footer but it does not effect the code but only a warning.
         ## Responsive
         - as you can see it scales down when viewing in a different size to keep it's shape so it stays uninterrpted.
          <img src="./images/responsive-READme-img.jpg" alt="Timeline size change">

          - As we get into mobile mode inside the gallery it changes it shape by going off one image so the images are still visable to see. 
          <img src="./images/gallery-READme-img (2).jpg" alt="Gallery mobile size">

          - I used Google Developer tool to test the responsiveness of the website.

          # Unfixed Bugs
          - The sign up button in the index page is not responsive and could not fix it to scale down when going into different screen sizes.
          - after multiple attemps of trying to fix it I couldn't change the bug.
